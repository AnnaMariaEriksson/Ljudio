## Disclaimer!
This is currently a MVP, Minimal Viable Product, so it's far from finished and contains a few bugs, both in design and in general. I did it all by myself for a school project and earned the highest grade for it. It took about two weeks during spring of 2021 in a web development class at Newton Yrkeshögskola, Malmö.
